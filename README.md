# Health Tracker Project

## About this project and Who Will Use It?:

My project is a Meal tracker that allows users to log:

- What they had for their **meals** (breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks)
every day of the week from **Monday to Sunday**.
- How many **servings** they had of a certain food

This application can help users stick to their personal goals and motivate them to achieve those goals. 
It allows users to see visually the changes in their diet and the improvements in their lifestyles, 
which can help keep themselves accountable. Therefore, this application can be used by 
anyone who is wanting to keep track of their diet and is working towards a certain health goal. 

## Why is this project of interest to me?

Due to the pandemic, I have felt that health has become an even more relevant topic than before.
Recently, I have been setting health goals myself, which is why I am interested in creating a tracker that can allow 
users to track their meals consumed throughout the week to help them make better food choices.
I believe having a tracker that lets you see how you have been taking care
of yourself can benefit many people and help them achieve a healthier lifestyle.
