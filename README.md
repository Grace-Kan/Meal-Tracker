# Health Tracker

## About this project:

My project is a health tracker that allows users to log different aspects of their daily health activities and lifestyle. 
This includes:

- What they had for their **meals and snacks**
- **Water intake** (how many cups of water they had)
- Amount of **exercise** (in minutes)
- Hours of **sleep** they got


## Who will use it?

Anyone who is wanting to keep track of their health and is working towards a certain health goal. This application can 
help users stick to their personal goals and motivate them to achieve them. It allows users to see visually the changes and improvements in their 
lifestyles and keep themselves accountable. 

## Why is this project of interest to me?

Due to the pandemic, I have felt that health has become an even more relavent topic than before.
Recently, I have been setting health goals myself, which is why I am interested in creating a tracker that can allow 
users to see their progress throughout the days and thought it would a helpful application. I believe having a tracker that lets you see how you have been taking care
of yourself can benefit many people and help them achieve a healthier lifestyle.
