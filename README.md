# Health Tracker Project

## About this project:

My project is a Meal tracker that allows users to log:

- What they had for their **meals and snacks** every day of the week
- **Water intake** (how many cups of water they had) every day of the week

## Who will use it?

This application can help users stick to their personal goals and motivate them to achieve them. It allows users to see visually the changes and improvements in their
lifestyles and keep themselves accountable. Therefore, anyone who is wanting to keep track of their health and is working towards a certain health goal. 

## Why is this project of interest to me?

Due to the pandemic, I have felt that health has become an even more relevant topic than before.
Recently, I have been setting health goals myself, which is why I am interested in creating a tracker that can allow 
users to see their progress throughout the days and thought it would a helpful application. 
I believe having a tracker that lets you see how you have been taking care
of yourself can benefit many people and help them achieve a healthier lifestyle.
